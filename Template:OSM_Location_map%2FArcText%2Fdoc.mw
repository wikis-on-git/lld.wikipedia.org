==Text on an arc==
This sub-template is used by {{tl|OSM Location map}} to provide a facility to place text that follows an arc across the map. In conjection with other labels, markers and map features, this allows text for larger geographic features to convey a sense of a broader area, or to follow the curve of a river, mountain range, coastline, etc. This works entirely separately from the other labels in the template. It does not attach itself to any mark or dot, and does not create any fullscreen markers. It requires coordinates for the location of the first letter, and additional parameters for the starting angle, radius of arc and gap between letters. Text size and color can also be specified, or inherited from Default settings.

| The nature of the earth's coordinate system means that there will be some variation in an arc at different latitudes and at different zoom levels. The program makes corrections for this, but there will still be residual variation. Similarly, changes in radius will also have some effect on the gap size, with a larger radius opening out the gap somewhat. There will therefore need to be considerable trial and correction to get the shape and effect desired. As a general rule, identify the coordinates of the required start-point, then choose a starter-pattern from the selection below, and then adjust parameters to fit the requirement of the map.
