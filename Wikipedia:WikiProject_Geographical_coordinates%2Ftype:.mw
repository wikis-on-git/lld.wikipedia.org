The <code>type:</code> parameter specifies the type of location for reverse mapping (for instance, to select a marker icon in the [[Wikipedia:WikiMiniAtlas|WikiMiniAtlas]]).

It also sets the [[Scale (map)|map scale]], which can however be overridden by ''[[#dim:D|dim:]]'' or ''[[#scale:N|scale:]]''. 

Valid types are:
